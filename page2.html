<h1> During my free time </h1>
<p>During my free time, I would play with my Chicken and observe her and her behaviours.I personally find it very interesting. </p>
<p>Sometimes,When I am feeling evil,I would catch some insects like moth,housefly or crocroach and 'feed' it to my carnivorous plants. </p>
<p> Out of all of my plants,I personally like the pitcherplant the best.Not only does it have a big "cup" to kill more insects than usual,it also alows
  me to watch the insect die.</p>
<p> But,when I am feeling very very bored,I would play a game of chess.(this usually occupies me for a long period of time). </p>
